Instructions:
Create a Github repo called ‘data-enrichment’ in your account, and write python code that will enrich SPARCS.csv with
public health information from the Neighborhood Atlas and if you want to, but not manditory, you can choose another dataset of your choice

1)For the Neighborhood Atlas, go to: https://www.neighborhoodatlas.medicine.wisc.edu/, 
(I chose file---> \NeighborhoodAtlas2015\AL_2015_ADI_9 Digit_Zip_Code_v3_1_upd_new_col.csv)

2)For the Hospital Inpatient Discharges (SPARCS) data (.csv), please go to https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Hospital-Inpatient-Discharges-SPARCS-De-Identified/82xm-y6g8 and download the .csv file 

3)Another dataset of my choice is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tunguz/inpatient-prospective-payment-system-ipps/download?datasetVersionNumber=1
(file---->>>>Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS)\Inpatient_Prospective_Payment_System.csv)

The data that you decide to enrich with, should be based/linked to either a zipcode, county, city, or state level to the SPARCS.csv


PLEASE NOTE: if you run into any issues and can not fully complete this assignment, please submit via github as much as you can by the deadline; i will be doing a 'soft' grade as discussed and reviewing your attempt, and not docking any points if you can not get it to work - what i want to see is your attempt. thus if you run into any issues, please upload screen shots to your github repo of the errors you ran into, and describe your thought process for how you attempted to go about, but perhaps ultimately unsuccessful in removing said errors



# DataEnrichment

NOTE TO PROFESSOR:

The *.csv files are large. Github is not able to receive the files and code.
I was able to run code with no error in local VS Code.

After i hid the *.csv files in .gitignore....(so that i can push to GITHUP) and ran the code again, i ran into error the "file not found."

Please advise.
